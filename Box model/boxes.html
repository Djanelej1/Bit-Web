    I used to work hard. The 18-hour days. The 7-day weeks.
But I didn’t start making big money until I did less-a lot less.
For example, this ad took about 2 hours to write. With a little luck, it should earn me 50, maybe a hundred thousand dollars.
What’s more, I’m going to ask you to send me 10 dollars for something that’ll cost me no more than 50 cents. And I’ll try to make it so irresistible that you’d be a darned fool not to do it.
After all, why should you care if I make $9.50 profit if I can show you how to make a lot more?
What if I’m not sure that you will make money my Lazy Man’s Way that I’ll make you a most unusual guarantee?
And here it is: I won’t even cash your check or money order for 31 days after I’ve sent you my material.
That’ll give you plenty of time to get it, look it over, try it out.
If you don’t agree that it’s worth at least a hundred times what you invested, send it back. Your uncashed check or money order will be put in the return mail.
The only reason I won’t send it to you and bill you or send it C.O.D. is because both these methods involve more time and money.
And I’m already going to give you the biggest bargain of your life.
Because I’m going to tell you what it took me 11 years to perfect: How to make money the Lazy Man’s Way.

    O.K.-now I have to brag a little. I don’t mind it. And it’s necessary – to prove that sending me the 10 dollars… which I’ll keep “in escrow” until you’re satisfied…is the smartest thing you ever did.
I live in a home that’s worth $250,000. I know it is, because I turned down an offer for that much. My mortgage is less than half that, and the only reason I haven’t paid it off is because my Tax Accountant says I’d be an idiot.
My “office”, about a mile and a half from my home, is right on the beach. My view is so breathtaking that most people comment that they don’t see how I get any work done. But I do enough. About 6 hours a day, 8 or 9 months a year.
The rest of the time we spend at our mountain “cabin”. I paid $30,000 for it –cash.
I have 2 boats and a Cadillac. All paid for. 
We have stocks, bonds, investments, cash in the bank. But the most important thing I have is priceless: time with my family.
And I’ll show you just how I did it- the Lazy Man’s Way – a secret that I’ve shared with just a few friends ‘til now.
It doesn’t require “education”. I’m a high school graduate.
It doesn’t require “capital”. When I started out, I was so deep in debt that a lawyer friend advised bankruptcy as the only way out. He was wrong. We paid off our debts and, outside of the mortgage, don’t owe a cent to any man.
It doesn’t require “luck”. I’ve had more than my share, but I’m not promising you that you’ll make as much money as I have. And you may do better; I personally know one man who used these principles, worked hard, and made 11 million dollars in 8 years. But money isn’t everything.
