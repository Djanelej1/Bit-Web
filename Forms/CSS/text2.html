    <h1> Naslov</h1>
    <p1>I used to work hard. The 18-hour days. The 7-day weeks.
        But I didn\t start making big money until I did less-a lot less.
        For example, this ad took about 2 hours to write. With a little luck, it should earn me 50, maybe a hundred thousand dollars.
        What\s more, I\m going to ask you to send me 10 dollars for something that’ll cost me no more than 50 cents. And I’ll try to make it so irresistible that you’d be a darned fool not to do it.
        After all, why should you care if I make $9.50 profit if I can show you how to make a lot more?
        What if I\m not sure that you will make money my Lazy Man\s Way that I’ll make you a most unusual guarantee?

        It doesn’t require <q1>talent</q1>. Just enough brains to know what to look for. And I’ll tell you that. 
It doesn’t require “youth”. One woman I worked with is over 70. She’s travelled the world over, making all the money she needs, doing only what I taught her. 
It doesn’t require “experience”. A widow in Chicago has been averaging $25,000 a year for the past 5 years, using my methods. 
What does require? Belief. <q2>Enough to take a chance</q2>. Enough to absorb what I’ll send you. Enough to put the principles into action. If you do just that – nothing more, nothing less- the result will be hard to believe. Remember – I guarantee it. 
<span>You don’t have to give up your job.</span> But you may soon be making so much money that you’ll be able to. Once again – I guarantee it. 
The wisest man I ever knew told me something I never forgot: <q3>>Most people are too busy earning a living to make any money.”</q3>
Don’t take as long as I did to find out he was right. 
I’ll prove it to you, if you’ll send in the coupon now. I’m not asking you to “believe” me. Just try it. If I’m wrong, all you’ve lost is a couple of minutes and a postage stamp. But what if I’m right?
